# Vulnerability-Management-with-Nessus-Essentials-on-VMWare

## Overview
In this project, I have set up a virtual environment using VMWare and implemented vulnerability management with Nessus Essentials. The objective was to conduct four distinct scans on a Windows 11 host: a non-credentialed scan, a credentialed scan, and a credentialed scan on a system intentionally made vulnerable with an outdated version of Firefox, and a fourth scan for vulnerability remediation.

## Installation and Configuration
### 1. VMWare Setup
Installed VMWare on my host machine.
Created a virtual machine with Windows 11 as the guest operating system.
### 2. Nessus Essentials Installation
Downloaded and installed Nessus Essentials on the Windows 11 virtual machine.
Ensured the Nessus scanner is properly configured and accessible.

### 3. Adjust VM Settings
<b>Enabled Remote Registry</b>:
- Accessed the Services Manager by searching services.msc.
- Located and started the Remote Registry service.

##
- <b>Enabled Printer and File Sharing</b>:
Configured sharing settings in the VM to enhance vulnerability exposure.

##
- <b>Disabled Firewall</b>:
Temporarily disabled the VM firewall to improve scan results.

##
- <b>Disabled User Account Control (UAC):</b>
Disabled UAC to ensure uninterrupted scanning and facilitate comprehensive vulnerability assessment by removing access restrictions and avoiding potential false positives.

##

- <b>Install Deprecated Firefox:</b>
Downloaded and installed an outdated version of Firefox from here <https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/>.

## Scans
### 1. Non-Credentialed Scan
Ran a Nessus vulnerability scan without providing any credentials.
Observed and documented vulnerabilities visible without authentication.

### 2. Credentialed Scan
Inserted Credentials of the VM in Nessus:
Configured Nessus to use valid credentials.
Ran a vulnerability scan to leverage enhanced access.
Identified and documented the improved scan results.

### 3. Credentialed Scan with Outdated Firefox
- Installed Deprecated Firefox:
Installed the intentionally vulnerable Firefox on the VM.
- Rescanned the VM:
Ran a Nessus vulnerability scan with credentials.
Identified and documented the impact of having the deprecated version of Firefox.

### 4. Vulnerability Remediation Scan
- Addressed and fixed vulnerabilities identified in the third scan.
- Re-scanned the VM to ensure successful remediation.
- Identified and documented on the remediated vulnerabilities.

## Notes and Observations
### Scan 1
- Scan 1, being non-credentialed, revealed minimal vulnerabilities. The lack of credentials limited the depth of the scan, providing only surface-level insights into potential security issues.


### Scan 2
- Scan 2, a credentialed scan, identified critical vulnerabilities:
Curl Version Update Required:
Identified that the installed Curl version needs to be updated to 8.4.0, with a CVSS score of 9.8 (critical).


### Scan 3
- Scan 3, a credentialed scan with the deprecated version of Firefox, exposed multiple vulnerabilities associated with Firefox. The recommendations included updating to Firefox 22.0 or later to address these security concerns.

  
### Scan 4
- Scan 4, conducted after removing the deprecated version of Firefox, demonstrated successful remediation of the Firefox vulnerability. This affirms the effectiveness of the mitigation measures taken during the project.

  
## Conclusion
This project showcases the practical application of Nessus Essentials in a controlled environment, emphasizing steps to enable/disable specific configurations, and intentionally introduce vulnerabilities for assessment.
